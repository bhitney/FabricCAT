# Day After Dashboard in a Day with Microsoft Fabric

## Introduction
In the Day After Dashboard in a Day with Microsoft Fabric you will learn about various advanced analytics experiences in Microsoft Fabric, such as the [Direct Lake](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/enterprise/directlake-overview) mode with Synapse Data Engineering, [data destination](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-factory/dataflows-gen2-overview#data-destinations) with Data Factory, and designing stunning reports and more with Power BI.

This course assumes that you have a working knowledge of authoring using Power BI Desktop and content sharing via the Microsoft Fabric service (cloud).

### Prerequisites
The content in this lab requires access to a **Premium** workspace within the Microsoft Fabric service.
- Premium capacity subscription
- **Note:** Premium Per User ***is not*** supported.

For additional system requirements, see [prerequisites for the lab](./Prerequisites.md)
